AppArmor is a security module for Linux that provides mandatory access control (MAC) capabilities. It was originally developed by Novell (now owned by Micro Focus) and is now a part of the Linux kernel. AppArmor allows administrators to restrict the permissions of individual applications, limiting their access to system resources such as files, network connections, and other processes.

AppArmor works by defining security profiles for each application that specify the permissions and restrictions that should be enforced. These profiles are typically stored in files in the /etc/apparmor.d/ directory. Each profile consists of a set of rules that define which system resources the application can access and how it can access them. For example, a profile might allow an application to read a particular file, but not write to it.

When an application starts up, the AppArmor module checks its security profile to determine what permissions it should have. If the application attempts to access a resource that is not allowed by its profile, the AppArmor module blocks the access and generates an audit log entry. This helps to prevent security breaches by limiting the damage that can be done by a compromised application.

AppArmor is often used in combination with other security modules such as SELinux to provide additional layers of protection. Together, these modules can help to ensure the security and integrity of a Linux system.
